# Description
"Flappy Bird AI" an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can autonomously play the popular mobile game Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm. The NEAT algorithm will be used to evolve neural networks that control the behavior of the in-game character, navigating it through obstacles by flapping its wings. The project will start with a population of simple neural networks with minimal connectivity, and evolve them over generations using genetic operators like mutation and crossover. The performance of each network will be evaluated based on its ability to achieve high scores in the game, and the fittest networks will be selected to produce offspring for the next generation. Through iterative evolution, the AI system is expected to learn and adapt to the game's dynamics, eventually producing neural networks with optimized strategies for playing Flappy Bird.

# Features
- Simple and Lightweight
- Easy to run and clone
